Dear Data Science Team Lead,

I performed EDA on the sample sales data. The dataset did not have missing values or irregular values so no cleaning was performed.

According to the data:
- Fruits and vegetables are the most sold category of items.
- Total sales is right skewed with most of sales are between 0$-20$. 
- The distribution of payment methods are uniform with cash paying customers being a bit more.
- The distribution of `customer_type` is almost uniform with gold members being the fewest and non-member customers being the highest.

Recommendations:
- We need more data. The current sample only covers 7 days and 1 store. 
- We need to frame the specific problem statement that we want to solve. The current business problem is too broad, we should narrow down the focus in order to deliver a valuable end product
- We need more features. Based on the problem statement that we move forward with, we need more columns (features) that may help us to understand the outcome that we're solving for

Best regards, 

Najib Adan
